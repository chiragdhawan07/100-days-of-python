# 🐶 Day 58 (Part 1) – TinDog Website

A responsive landing page for **TinDog**, a fun concept website like Tinder but for dogs 🐾.  
This part covers the **Title and Features** sections built using HTML + Bootstrap 5.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Built with **Bootstrap grid system** for perfect responsiveness.  
2. The **title section** displays an app-style layout with gradient background and download buttons.  
3. The **features section** highlights key advantages with Bootstrap icons.  
4. Organized semantic sections for easy expansion (Testimonial, Pricing, Footer coming in Part 2).
