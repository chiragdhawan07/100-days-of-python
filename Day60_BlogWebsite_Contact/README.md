# ðŸ’Œ Day 60 â€“ Blog Website Contact Feature

Enhanced my Flask Blog Website by adding a fully functional **Contact Me** form that sends user messages directly to my email.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. User fills out the **Contact Form** on the website.
2. The form data (Name, Email, Phone, Message) is submitted via POST request.
3. Flask handles the backend logic and sends the message to my Gmail using `smtplib`.
4. User sees a **"Message Sent Successfully âœ…"** confirmation screen.
5. The mail is received instantly with all entered details.
