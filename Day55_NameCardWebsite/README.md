# 💼 Day 55 – Personal Name Card Website

A minimal **HTML-based digital name card** that showcases my identity, profession, and social links in a clean, professional layout. Built using the **HTML5UP Identity Template**, customized with my own design and information.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The main page (`index.html`) displays your name, role, and profile image.
2. Social media icons link directly to your professional profiles.
3. Simple styling from the HTML5UP template gives a modern, card-like look.
4. `main.py` can be used to serve the HTML page locally (Flask-based setup).
