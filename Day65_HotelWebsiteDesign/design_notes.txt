🖌️ DESIGN NOTES – Day 65 (Hotel Front Page Design)

🎯 Objective:
Create a modern-elegant landing page for a hotel website, using a warm cream-and-browns palette to convey comfort, luxury and approachability.

---

🎨 Color Palette:
• #F7F3EE – Light Cream (background, airy & inviting)  
• #D2C3B5 – Light Brown (secondary background, warmth)  
• #5D4231 – Dark Brown (text and accent, depth & sophistication)  
• #CCA678 – Gold/Accent Brown (calls-to-action, highlights)

These hues were chosen to reflect luxury without harsh contrast — aiming for a cozy premium feel.

---

🔠 Typography:
• Heading Font: Playfair Display (serif, elegant, upscale feel)  
• Body Font: Montserrat (sans-serif, clean, readable)  
These typefaces balance classic luxury (in headings) with modern legibility (in body text).

📐 Layout Structure:
1. Hero Section — Full-width image with hotel name + tagline + “Book Now” button  
2. About Section — Two-column layout: image on left, text on right describing the hotel’s story  
3. Rooms/Services Section — Card layout showing various room types with images and brief descriptions  
4. Gallery Section — Grid of interior & exterior photos highlighting ambiance and amenities  
5. Contact / CTA Section — Background in light cream, contact form or details, footer with links

---

✨ Design Highlights:
- Soft, warm background tones for a relaxed yet premium atmosphere  
- Consistent spacing and margins to maintain a sense of calm luxury  
- Use of dark brown for text ensures readability and elegance  
- Accent color (gold/brown) used sparingly for buttons and important tags to draw attention

---

💭 Future Conversion:
- This layout is already modular — each section is discrete and can translate into HTML/CSS blocks  
- Use responsive grid for cards and gallery for mobile view  
- Animation suggestions: subtle fade-in for sections, hover effect on room cards
