        I’m an aspiring AI and Python developer with a strong focus on building real-world projects that combine creativity and technology. Over the past months, I’ve been consistently developing my skills through the <strong>#100DaysOfCode</strong> challenge — creating everything from automation tools and data analysis apps to interactive games and AI-powered assistants like <strong>Jarvis</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is to become a full-time software developer capable of solving real problems using code. I love experimenting with new technologies, improving every project I build, and learning how to write cleaner, smarter, and more efficient code each day.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blog showcases my growth — the projects I’ve built, the lessons I’ve learned, and the mindset that drives me to keep improving. I believe that consistent learning and curiosity are the foundations of great software engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I’m expanding my expertise in <strong>AI, machine learning, and automation</strong>, while building a portfolio that reflects my dedication to both learning and execution.
