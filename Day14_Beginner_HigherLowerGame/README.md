# 🔼 Day 14 – Higher Lower Game

A fun game where you guess which celebrity/account has more Instagram followers.  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Two random accounts are shown with their description and country.  
2. You must guess which account has more followers by typing **A** or **B**.  
3. If correct, your score increases, and the game continues with the winner carried forward.  
4. If wrong, the game ends and your final score is displayed.
