# ☕ Day 62 – Coffee & Wifi 💻  
A sleek Flask web app to explore and rate cafés based on coffee quality, Wi-Fi speed, and power socket availability. Perfect for remote workers and students hunting the best work-friendly spots!

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Visit the homepage and click **“Show Me!”** to explore nearby cafés.  
2. View café details like open/close timings, Wi-Fi strength, and power socket ratings.  
3. Add your own café using the **Add Café** form — complete with validation and emoji ratings.  
4. All data is stored in a CSV file and displayed dynamically through Flask templates.
