# ☕ Day 62 – Coffee & Wifi 💻  
A stylish Flask web app to explore and rate cafés based on coffee quality, Wi-Fi strength, and power socket availability.  
Ideal for freelancers, students, or anyone who loves working with a good cup of coffee!

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Open the app to explore a curated list of cafés with real ratings.  
2. View café details including **Wi-Fi strength**, **coffee quality**, and **power socket access**.  
3. Use the **Add Café** form to contribute new spots easily.  
4. All entries are stored in a simple **CSV file** and displayed dynamically on the cafés page.
