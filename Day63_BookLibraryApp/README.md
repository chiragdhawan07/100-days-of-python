# 📚 Day 63 – Book Library Web App

A simple Flask web app to manage your personal book collection.  
You can **add new books, edit their ratings, and delete entries** — all stored neatly in a SQLite database.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The **homepage** displays your complete library list.  
2. Click **“Add New Book”** to insert a new book with title, author, and rating.  
3. Use **“Edit Rating”** to update a book’s score.  
4. Hit **“Delete”** to remove a book from the collection.  
5. All data updates instantly in the SQLite database.
